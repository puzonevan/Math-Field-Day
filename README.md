# Overview 
Math Field Day is a tournament or competition played between school districts in elementary or middle school. Each school would have a team of students who excelled in games and math. Each student would be assigned to one game and one math based event. 

The games at my school district were 5 in a Row, Capture, 3-D Tic Tac Toe, Hex, and Mancala. There are links below to each game. Go ahead and click on one and then go try playing with a friend.
